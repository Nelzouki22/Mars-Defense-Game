# Mars Defense Game
Project Title: Mars Defense Game

Description: Developed a 2D action game using Python and Pygame where players control a tank to defend against enemy platforms and UFOs on Mars. The game features real-time shooting mechanics, dynamic enemy movements, and collision detection. Upon successfully destroying all enemy targets, the game displays a "Victory!" message. This project involves implementing game logic, handling user inputs, and graphical rendering, showcasing a comprehensive understanding of game development principles.

Key Features:

Player controls a tank that can shoot rockets.
Enemies include stationary platforms and moving UFOs.
Real-time collision detection between rockets and enemies.
Victory screen displayed upon defeating all enemies.
Dynamic game environment with orange Martian background.
